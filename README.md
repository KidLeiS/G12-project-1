# Flight Flamingo

## Description

Flight Flamingo is a project made up by three developers. Eric Shen, Adrian Lamour and Curtis Bowen. Each person has had an important role to play in the development of this application.

We we're tasked to come up with an idea and of our own and build an application around that idea. Once we decided on an idea, we then moved onto naming our project. Since the idea we came up with was around travel and flights, Flight Flamingo sat well with us all.

The application allows a user to travel around the world. Booking a flight from one destination to another, with a return while having the options to include multiple people to the flight and what class they to choose to fly.

This was a our first project within the EdX bootcamp where we had set teams to work within. This has given us in insight to how the industry how working as part of a team.
